------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
We initially did partA and partB,C in two different branches.
Before we handed in, we merged these two branches together. However,
the problem is that partA passed almost all usertests without problem
except for 'sbrkarg'. What in xv6-lazy-output.txt is the output that we run 
the test for partA before merging. However, the problem occured with partB, 
it would panic if we run usertests for partB. Therefore, if you try to run 
usertests right now, it will not show the same output as xv6-lazy-output.txt,
but that is what we actally get without the problem of partB. Besides, there is
no problem with running 'echo hi' and 'lazyalloc', all tests passed for them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We made the following changes:

1. Makefile: added $U/_lazytests\

2. kernel/defs.h: defined the newly added functions: vmprint and lazyalloc

3. kernel/exec.c: called vmprint

4. kernal/sysproc.c: eliminated allocation from sbrk

5. kernel/trap.c: made changes to userstrap, let it call lazyalloc to do lazy
allocation

6. kernel/vm.c: added two functions, vmprint and lazyalloc, made changed to 
uvmunmap, mappages, uvmcopy
	
	- vmprint is the function grabbed from our lab6 to print page table

	- lazyalloc is the function to handle the job of doing lazy allocation

	- mappages: removed the line panic("remap")
	
	- uvmnmap: removed the line panic("uvmunmap: walk") and panic("uvmunmap
	: not mapped")

7. sysproc.c: modified sys_sbrk to delete page allocation and let it handle 
negative arguments

------------------------------Purpose------------------------------
The objective of this project is to develop a monitor with IPC

Files contained:

Monitor.h
Monitor.c
reader-writer-monitor.h
reader-writer-monitor.c (given file)
reader-writer.c (given file)
list.h (from assignment1)
list_adders.c (from assignment1)
list_movers.c (from assignment1)
list_removers.c (from assignment1)

------------------------------Description------------------------------
We declared the following queues:
LIST* enterQ
    - The queue which contains the processes which are going to enter the monitor
LIST* urgentQ
    - The urgent queue
LIST* cvQ[TOTAL_CVS];
    - The array of lists. Each queue is used by each conditional variable

------------------------------Procedures------------------------------
    MonInit()
We initialize the queues by ListCreate()

    MonEnter()
To be called before a process going to enter the monitor

    MonLeave()
To be called before a process going to leave the monitor

    MonServer()
The IPC server

    MonWait()
Blocks an executing process and push it into the conditional variable

    MonSignal()
Reactivates the blocked process in the head of the conditional variable

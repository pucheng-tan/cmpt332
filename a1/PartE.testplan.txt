The implementation of partE is not albe to handle pipeline,
so no pipeline operation will be tested.

Call ./partE, the shell program starts.

Test 'enter' first, the program should keep prompt pwd and ask for input.

Test cd, both absolute path and relative path.
For example:
cd test
cd ..
cd ~
cd ~/CMPT332

Test linux command execution.
For example:
ls
touch test
rm test
make
make clean

Test for wrong input.
Random string like: asdfg

Test for quit/exit.

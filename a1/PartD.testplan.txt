We have a function void create_process(void) in test_numprocs.c
which helps us to create child process.

There is a for loop in the function create_process, in which we
set how many times the loop repeat to control how many process it
creates.

We set three tests. For the first test, We let it create 1 process
and check if the system call gives us the correct output

For the second test, we let it create 5 process and check if the 
system call gives us the correct output

For the third test, we let it create 10 process and check if the  
system call gives us the correct output

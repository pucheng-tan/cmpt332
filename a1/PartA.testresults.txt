Segmentation fault (core dumped)
# partA2 failed to create more than 3 child threads.

PartA2 failed to create more than 3 child threads,
so the rest of the tests all have segmentation fault.
It looks like Posix thread is creating thread in sequence,
unlike UBCpthread which is asynchronous.
The parent wakes up before all the children created which causes segmentation fault.
It might be solved by giving parent and child threads different priority.
